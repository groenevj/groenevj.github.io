                    Problem Statement: Mask Selection
                    <p>
                        Our user base consists of a wide variety of consumers, each with specific preferences about face coverings. With such a vast array of options on the market, one can easily get confused with whichever variety works best for them. Our goal is to help users find a comfortable and effective mask.
